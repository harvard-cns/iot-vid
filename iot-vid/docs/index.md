# Optimized Video Analytics for IoT: from Edge to Cloud

We tackle the growing challenge of processing and analyzing video data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, focusing on applications from autonomous vehicles to retail surveillance. The research advanced the field by optimizing how video data moves and gets processed across three key layers: IoT devices themselves, local computing centers (edge), and remote data centers (cloud). The project's significance lies in its comprehensive approach to solving video analytics challenges through innovations in computing, networking, and analytics algorithms.
