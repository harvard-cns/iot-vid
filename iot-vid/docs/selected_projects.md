> Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems are essential for generating digital representations of physical environments. They are widely used in applications involving autonomous robot navigation, 3D visualization, and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). In this paper, we focus on OctoMap, a prominent 3D mapping framework that utilizes an octree-based data structure with voxel occupancy values to achieve spatial efficiency and explicit dense map representation. Our analysis indicates that OctoMap's performance is constrained by slow mapping system updates, primarily attributed to costly memory accesses within its octree data storage. To address this issue, we introduce OctoCache, a software system designed to accelerate OctoMap's performance. OctoCache dramatically improves the mapping system's update speed through three primary mechanisms: (1) optimization of cache memory access, (2) refinement of voxel ordering, and (3) workflow parallelization. OctoCache in 3D environment construction tasks demonstrates significant performance improvement, with speedups ranging from 45.63%~88.01% compared to the standard OctoMap implementation. Furthermore, we validate the OctoCache by deploying it in multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation scenarios to quantify the end-to-end benefits. Our results indicate up to 3.02× speedup and a reduction in mission completion time of up to 28% across four environments. These findings substantiate OctoCache's capacity to markedly enhance the efficiency of 3D mapping systems in critical autonomous navigation applications, potentially facilitating advancements in robotics and environmental modeling.

> Abstract: Autonomous machines (e.g., vehicles, mobile robots, drones) require sophisticated 3D mapping to perceive the dynamic environment. However, maintaining a real-time 3D map is expensive both in terms of compute and memory requirements, especially for resource-constrained edge machines. Probabilistic OctoMap is a reliable and memory-efficient 3D dense map model to represent the full environment, with dynamic voxel node pruning and expansion capacity. This paper presents the first efficient accelerator solution, i.e. OMU, to enable real-time probabilistic 3D mapping at the edge. To improve the performance, the input map voxels are updated via parallel PE units for data parallelism. Within each PE, the voxels are stored using a specially developed data structure in parallel memory banks. In addition, a pruning address manager is designed within each PE unit to reuse the pruned memory addresses. The proposed 3D mapping accelerator is implemented and evaluated using a commercial 12 nm technology. Compared to the ARM Cortex-A57 CPU in the Nvidia Jetson TX2 platform, the proposed accelerator achieves up to 62× performance and 708× energy efficiency improvement. Furthermore, the accelerator provides 63 FPS throughput, more than 2× higher than a real-time requirement, enabling real-time perception for 3D mapping.

> Abstract: The trend of modeless ML inference is increasingly growing in popularity as it hides the complexity of model inference from users and caters to diverse user and application accuracy requirements. Previous work mostly focuses on modeless inference in data centers. To provide low-latency inference, in this paper, we promote modeless inference at the edge. The edge environment introduces additional challenges related to low power consumption, limited device memory, and volatile network environments.
> 
> To address these challenges, we propose HawkVision, which provides low-latency modeless serving of vision DNNs. HawkVision leverages a two-layer edge-DC architecture that employs confidence scaling to reduce the number of model options while meeting diverse accuracy requirements. It also supports lossy inference under volatile network environments. Our experimental results show that HawkVision outperforms current serving systems by up to 1.6× in P99 latency for providing modeless service. Our FPGA prototype demonstrates similar performance at certain accuracy levels with up to a 3.34× reduction in power consumption.

> Abstract: Reliability and safety are critical in autonomous machine services, such as autonomous vehicles and aerial drones. In this paper, we first present an open-source Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) reliability analysis framework, MAVFI, to characterize transient fault’s impacts on the end-to-end flight metrics, e.g., flight time, success rate. Based on our framework, it is observed that the end-to-end fault tolerance analysis is essential for characterizing system reliability. We demonstrate the planning and control stages are more vulnerable to transient faults than the visual perception stage in the common “Perception-Planning-Control (PPC)” compute pipeline. Furthermore, to improve the reliability of the MAV system, we propose two low overhead anomaly-based transient fault detection and recovery schemes based on Gaussian statistical models and autoencoder neural networks. We validate our anomaly fault protection schemes with a variety of simulated photo-realistic environments on both Intel i9 CPU and ARM Cortex-A57 on Nvidia TX2 platform. It is demonstrated that the autoencoder-based scheme can improve the system reliability by 100% recovering failure cases with less than 0.0062% computational overhead in best-case scenarios. In addition, MAVFI framework can be used for other ROS-based cyber-physical applications and is open-sourced at [this link](https://github.com/harvard-edge/MAVBench/tree/mavfi).
