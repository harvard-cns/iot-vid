# Educational Activities

The project made substantial educational contributions to develop future technology leaders. It provided advanced training for eight graduate students and two undergraduate researchers who gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology. These students worked on various aspects of the project, from developing new algorithms to implementing and testing systems in real-world scenarios. An open educational platform was created at Harvard ([tinyml.seas.harvard.edu](tinyml.seas.harvard.edu)) that has reached over a thousand students, providing resources and tutorials on machine learning for IoT devices. The research findings were widely shared through seven peer-reviewed publications in leading venues such as NSDI, OSDI, ESWEEK, and DATE and multiple invited talks at major institutions, including Princeton, CMU, and EPFL.
