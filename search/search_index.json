The research advanced the field by optimizing how video data moves and gets processed across three key layers: IoT devices themselves, local computing centers (edge), and remote data centers (cloud). The project's significance lies in its comprehensive approach to solving video analytics challenges through innovations in computing, networking, and analytics algorithms.  </p>"},{"location":"educational_activities/","title":"Educational Activities","text":"<p>The project made substantial educational contributions to develop future technology leaders. It provided advanced training for eight graduate students and two undergraduate researchers who gained hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology. These students worked on various aspects of the project, from developing new algorithms to implementing and testing systems in real-world scenarios. An open educational platform was created at Harvard (tinyml.seas.harvard.edu) that has reached over a thousand students, providing resources and tutorials on machine learning for IoT devices. The research findings were widely shared through seven peer-reviewed publications in leading venues such as NSDI, OSDI, ESWEEK, and DATE and multiple invited talks at major institutions, including Princeton, CMU, and EPFL.</p>"},{"location":"impacts/","title":"Impacts","text":"<p>The research has demonstrated significant real-world impact through technology transfer to major cloud service providers, semiconductor manufacturers, and telecommunications companies. These partnerships have improved cloud infrastructure efficiency, enhanced capabilities of IoT devices worldwide, and stronger network security implementations.</p> <p>The project's comprehensive approach to video analytics optimization has laid crucial groundwork for the next generation of IoT applications. Integrating improved performance, enhanced reliability, and increased efficiency across all system layers - from individual devices to cloud processing - provides a robust foundation for future developments in IoT technology. This is particularly important as society increasingly relies on real-time video analysis and autonomous decision-making in applications ranging from urban planning to emergency response systems. The successful adoption of these technologies by industry demonstrates their immediate practical value. It suggests their lasting impact on processing and analyzing video data in our increasingly connected world.</p>"},{"location":"personnel/","title":"Personnel and Collaborators","text":""},{"location":"personnel/#alibaba-group","title":"Alibaba Group","text":"<p>Jiaqi Gao</p>"},{"location":"personnel/#georgia-institute-of-technology","title":"Georgia Institute of Technology","text":"<p>Zishen Wan</p>"},{"location":"personnel/#harvard-university","title":"Harvard University","text":"<p>David Brooks</p> <p>Jonathan Cruz</p> <p>Yu-Shun Hsiao</p> <p>Tianyu Jia</p> <p>ChonLam Lao</p> <p>Minghao Li</p> <p>Vijay Janapa Reddi</p> <p>Gu-Yeon Wei</p> <p>En-Yu Yang</p> <p>Minlan Yu</p>"},{"location":"personnel/#microsoft-research","title":"Microsoft Research","text":"<p>Ganesh Ananthanarayanan</p>"},{"location":"personnel/#university-of-maryland-college-park","title":"University of Maryland, College Park","text":"<p>Peiqing Chen</p> <p>Alan Zaoxing Liu</p>"},{"location":"personnel/#ut-austin","title":"UT Austin","text":"<p>Aditya Akella</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"projects/#omu","title":"OMU","text":"<p>Paper</p> <p>The OMU accelerator system transformed how flying devices like drones process their surroundings by introducing parallel processing units and efficient memory management. This system achieved faster processing, using two orders of magnitude less energy than standard processors, making autonomous navigation more practical and efficient. The research extended to safety considerations through the MAVFI framework, which addressed the critical challenge of system reliability. MAVFI enabled drones to detect and recover from silent system failures with minimal computational overhead, representing a significant advancement in autonomous system safety.</p>"},{"location":"projects/#octocache","title":"OctoCache","text":"<p>OctoMap is an accelerator for processing point cloud data for autonomous machines intelligently and effectively. We introduced OctoCache, a software system that dramatically improves the mapping system\u2019s update speed.
